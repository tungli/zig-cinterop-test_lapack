A very small test of Zig's C interop. Calls a LAPACKE linear system solution function.

Example based on [LAPACKE_dgesv Example Program in C for Column Major Data Layout](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/code-samples-lapack/2025-0/lapacke-dgesv-example-c-column.html).


Should run with:
```
zig build run
```
on zig-master (commit id 5c57e90ffb6d7498ec3d8bd06ae4a50a8a7a917d).
